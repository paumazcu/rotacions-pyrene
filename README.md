## Rotacions Pyrene App

This is a simple Streamlit app (in catalan) for automating the rotations needed in Pyrene Summer Camp. The app can be found at the link [rotacions-pyrene.streamlit.app](https://rotacions-pyrene.streamlit.app/).

The app consists in a simple form with 2 parts:
  - In the first part the user needs to input of a number between 1 and 6 (week num) and then input the names of the instructors separated by commas. Then it returns a schedule with tasks and the names distributed randomly following some restrictions. Furthermore it returns the count of tasks for each monitor and a link button to download the schedule as a excel file in case the user wants to modify the schedule manually.

  - In the second part of the form the user inputs a number (tipically between 1-3) for each camp. This number stands for the number of subgroups that each camp has. The result is a new table with the randomized subgroups following also some restrictions. Additionally like in the first timetable you have the oportunity to download the table as a excel file.
